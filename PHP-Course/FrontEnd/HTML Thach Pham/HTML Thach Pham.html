    <p>Queen Elizabeth II has been pictured riding a pony on the grounds of Windsor Castle, in her first photographed appearance since the coronavirus lockdown started in the UK.</p>

	<p>The 94-year-old Queen has been a passionate horse lover throughout her reign and was photographed over the weekend riding one of her ponies, a 14-year-old Fell Pony called Balmoral Fern. On Sunday, the Royal Family’s verified Twitter page posted photos of the Queen riding.</p>

	<p>The Queen has made two televised addresses during the lockdown, the first assuring those in isolation that "we will meet again" and the other to mark VE Day.</p>
    <p>After spending a month in an induced coma due to Covid-19, Dom, a 5-month-old Brazilian baby, gets to go home and celebrate his 6-month birthday.</p>
    <p>A few months after he was born, Dom was diagnosed with Covid-19 at the Pro-Cardiaco hospital in Rio de Janeiro.
He spent 54 days in the hospital -- 32 of them in an induced coma and connected to a ventilator, Dom's father, Wagner Andrade, told CNN.</p>
    <p>"He had some difficulty breathing so the doctors thought it was a bacterial infection," he said. "But the medication didn't work and he got worse. Then me and my wife decided to take him to a second hospital and they tested him. It was coronavirus."</p>
    <p>It remains uncertain how Dom contracted coronavirus. He may have been exposed during a visit to a relative's home, according to Andrade.
"My wife noticed this noise at the end of his breathing," he said. "We called a few doctors and one of them told us to record a video. After she saw it, she ordered us to take him immediately to the hospital."
</p>
    <p>Andrade and his wife, Viviane Monteiro, say it was a "miracle" that Dom recovered.</p>
    <p>"First, I felt relieved, and then indescribable happiness," Andrade said. "We were longing to get him back home for more than 50 days."
</p>
    <p>Dom will celebrate his 6-month birthday on June 14 at home with his parents, surrounded virtually by relatives.

    <p>Brazil has reported at least 25 Covid-19-related deaths among babies up to 12 months of age, according to data from the country's ministry of health.
</p>
    <p>In the last week, Latin America has become the epicenter of the global pandemic. With 465,166 confirmed cases of the virus and 27,878 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data, Brazil is the hardest hit country in the region.

    <p>CNN's Tatiana Arias wrote in Atlanta and Journalist Rodrigo Pedroso reported from Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p>
    <p>An ex-engineer, who’s been working for years at one of the largest internet providers in Germany, came up with this idea to solve this issue. He always knew that people pay full price for the service that sometimes barely works, and that internet operators control this process…
</p>
    <p>He never felt happy about being a part of this.
</p>
    <p>His solution was to create a device that would be able to bypass ISP's speed throttling while increasing WiFi's range and speed around your house. He wanted it to be as simple as possible, so that anyone, even the least tech-savvy ones, would be able to use it.</p>

    <p>Bogdan Vechirko, the man who drove a tanker truck into a crowd of protesters on a Minnesota interstate on Sunday night, has been charged with assault, according to records at the Hennepin County Jail.

The incident took place on the I-35W bridge. Aerial video from CNN affiliate WCCO appears to show Vechirko in a scrum with protesters as officers took him away, and law enforcement said he was treated at a hospital. A mugshot of Vechirko shows what appear to be minor injuries to his nose and eyes.

It appears no protesters were hurt, said the Department of Public Safety, which described Vechirko’s actions as “inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators.” 

Vechirko is now being held without bail.</p>
	<p>The Washington DC fire department is extinguishing a fire in the basement of St. John's Church, it said on Twitter.

The iconic church is just blocks from the White House, and is known as the “Church of the Presidents” because many presidents have attended services there, including President Donald Trump.

There have been protests in the area all day, and protesters set several fires there Sunday evening.

The city is now under curfew, which went into effect at 11 p.m. local time and will be active until 6 a.m. Monday morning.</p>
    <p>Earlier tonight, the George Floyd family had their first direct communication with the Minneapolis Police Department live on CNN's special program "I Can't Breathe: Black Men Living and Dying in America."

George Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, asked Police Chief Medaria Arradondo whether he would arrest the officers and get justice for George's death.

Speaking directly to Philonise, Arradondo said those decisions would come through the County Attorney's Office.

He also took off his hat every time he addressed the Floyd family to show respect, and said those who stood silent in the face of injustice were complicit.</p>
	<p>(CNN) — Although most governments are still advising against "nonessential" international travel, a host of popular destinations are beginning to ease their Covid-19 lockdown measures and border restrictions and are moving toward welcoming tourists back.
Earlier this month, the European Union unveiled an action plan to reopen its internal borders in time for summer, while countries such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have formed "travel bubbles," lifting restrictions for each other's citizens.
A number of Caribbean islands are preparing to open their doors to foreign visitors in June, while destinations such as Mexico and Thailand are planning to open up again region by region in the coming weeks.
If you're one of many travelers eagerly awaiting news on where you can travel to this year, here's a guide to the top destinations making plans to reopen, as well as some of those that are keeping their borders firmly closed for now.

    <p>Cyprus is so keen to get its tourism industry back on track, officials are offering to cover the costs of any travelers who test positive for Covid-19 while on vacation in the Mediterranean island nation.
According to a letter shared with CNN, the Cypriot government will pay for lodging, as well as food, drink and medication for tourists who are taken ill with coronavirus during their visit.
The detailed plan was set out in a five-page letter issued to governments, airlines and tour operators on May 26.
Officials have also earmarked a 100-bed hospital for foreign travelers who test positive, while a 500-room "quarantine hotel" will be available to patients' family and "close contacts."</p>
    <p>"The traveler will only need to bear the cost of their airport transfer and repatriation flight, in collaboration with their agent and/or airline," states the letter.
The news came shortly after Cyprus Transport Minister Yiannis Karousos announced hotels in the country will reopen on June 1, while international air travel will restart on June 9.
Once the destination reopens, visitors from only chosen countries will be allowed to enter.
Officials have issued a list of countries to be granted access to Cyprus in two separate stages.
Incoming flights from Greece, Malta, Bulgaria, Norway, Austria, Finland, Slovenia, Hungary, Israel, Denmark, Germany, Slovakia and Lithuania will be authorized first.
From June 20, Cyprus will also permit incoming flights from Switzerland, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Estonia and the Czech Republic.
</p>
    <p>The UK and the US, both listed among the nations with the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths, are noticeably absent.
However, the list is to be expanded to include further countries in the coming months.
Travelers heading to Cyprus will need to provide a valid certificate proving they've tested negative for Covid-19, while they'll be subject to temperature checks on arrival as well as testing at random during the course of their trip.
The destination has already put measures in place to protect travelers and residents, such as ensuring hotel staff wear masks and gloves, regularly disinfecting sunbeds and keeping tables at restaurants, bars, cafés,and pubs at least two meters (6.5 feet) apart.</p>
